# Multi-class Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
Basic convolutional neural networks for measuring and comparing the effects of using different number of patience with early stopping on the multi-class classification loss for multi-class image classification.

For all the experiments, we used the [SVHN dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).

Early stopping is utilized to avoid overfitting while training.

For the early stopping, the following patience values are tested:
Patience (epochs) |
:-: |
0 |
1 |
2 |
5 |
